		<h1>Our Story</h1>
		<div class="story">
			<p>
				We are committed to the production and marketing of high quality, handmade,unique hats, designed and built to provide an enduring appeal. 
				In Hat corner, we take the best of part of past and present hat production techniques to bring our pieces of true quality and longevity. 
				From concept to final incarnation, each Hat Corner piece is designed and made with a view of being a special feature on your head or in your shelf for generations. 
				We back up this commitment with a 10 years warranty against manufacturing faults. 
				Our premise is to design hats which go forward with us, which convey value and allow customers to express their identity. 
				People are the at the core of Hat Corner's ethos: we create for, and are thankful to, the discerning customer.

				Hi, I am Kelly Cramer, one of the designers in Hat Corner. I’ve learned painting about 20 years. 
				When I am in elementary school, I started to learn sketching and doing watercolor. 
				When I entered high school, I started to find out that I was also passionate about handmaking. 
				When I got into university, I chose graphic design as my major. In these 4 years study, I learned the creative thinking method, 
				art history and some graphic design software. Together, both handmade and design skills help me better transfer my ideas from abstract to something visual. 
				I got a chance in working in a customized t-shirt company where I was inspired to have a handmade store.

				Hi, I am Susanna Russa. I am the designer of the Hat Corner. I have completed by bachelor degree of graphic design and fashion design. 
				I have worked in a fashion company, photography school, and design school. I love taking pictures. In my free time, 
				I always like to go out and explore things in this world. Whenever I find something interesting or thought- provoking I could not wait to capture it down. 
				They are inspiration to our design projects. They work like a spark!<br>
				We always think about how to produce creative ideas for making the hats more collectable and wearable. 
				When both of us really focus on brainstorming the ideas, we do not eat much but we start going out and finding inspiration. 
				We do this because we think that story is the most important thing in the design process. We believe that story is the backbone for each hat. 
				It brings hat to life and it would reflect the collector’s tastes and feelings.
